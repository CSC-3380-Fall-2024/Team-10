we were unable to figure out how to get all our code into one file so you will have to launch one by one

when in the file double click on the purp-crash out folder, then double click on the game maker project purp crash-out
this will bring up the main menu where you could see play and options, in the options you are able to change to volume for music
and it will save if you leave you are able to change the controls as well which was set up if we were able to link our projects together
i would of also been able to make a slider for the effects volume easily, it is absent here because it wouldn't run due to not having
sound effects once done close out of game maker and go back to the start of the files
