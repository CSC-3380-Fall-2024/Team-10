Purp Crash-out

Beginning 
Our story begins with Purp sitting in his house, admiring everything he has accumulated throughout his life. He then enters the kitchen, where he notices his favorite gummy snack has gone missing. Being the prideful and petty creature he is, Purp embarks on a quest to find out who took his snacks and deal with them in the only way he knows—through sheer ignorance.

Level 1
Purp exits his estate and goes after the first person he thinks could be responsible—his mother. Purp must traverse a short but fun movement-based platformer to reach her house. There may or may not be enemies; the point of this section is simply to get used to traversal and break up the monotony of mini-games throughout the story. Once he enters his mother’s house, a mini-game will start.

Level 2
After realizing that his mother doesn't have the snacks, Purp must return to his house to retrieve his ship. This level features the same design as the first, but in reverse, as he backtracks. Along the way, there may be mini-games, and a boss guarding his ship. The boss fight will be a platformer where the boss throws projectiles, and Purp must dodge them to attack and defeat the boss. Once Purp reaches his ship, the next mini-game starts: an asteroid shooter, incorporating elements from the asteroid shooter games that both Trent and I programmed.

Level 3 
Purp arrives on an alien planet in search of his next potential target. Upon arrival, he acquires a vehicle (whether he steals it or not is undecided). This starts a mini-game where he causes chaos until he reaches a specific score, allowing him to drive to the destination. Afterward, he enters the location and encounters the next boss, an alien named Galizon.
