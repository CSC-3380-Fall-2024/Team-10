Purp Crash-out 

 

 

Beginning 

Our story starts with Purp sitting around his house admiring everything he’s accumulated throughout his life. He then enters his kitchen where he notices his favorite gummy snack has gone missing. Purp being the prideful and petty creature he is embarks on a quest to find who took his snacks and to handle them in the only way he knows how… ignorance.  

 

Level 1  

Purp exists his estate and goes for the first person that the think would do such a thing… his mother. Purp will then go through a short but fun movement-based platformer to get to his mother’s house. There may or may not be enemies the point of this section is to just get used to traversal and break up the monotony of mini games throughout the story. Once he enters his mother’s house a mini game will start.  

 

Level 2  

Purp realizes that his mother does not have the snacks so, he must go back to his house to get the ship. This will be the same level design as the first level but in reverse since he is now backtracking. This will lead to (potential) mini games and a boss who is guarding his ship. This boss fight will be a platformer where the boss is throwing projectiles, and you must avoid these projectiles to attack, and defeat said boss. Once Purp gets to his ship the next mini game will start which is an asteroid shooter taking elements from the separate asteroid shooter games that both Trent and I programmed.  

 

Level 3  

Purp arrives on an alien planet to find his next potential target. Once he arrives, he will acquire a vehicle (not sure if he will steal it or not) this will start a mini game where he is causing chaos until he reaches a specific score allowing him to drive to the destination. He then enters the destination and runs into the next boss and alien named Galizon.
